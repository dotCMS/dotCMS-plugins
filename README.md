# Official Patches and Hotfixes 

This repo contains official dotCMS patches and hotfixes for security and other issues that require immediate code fixes.  For more information regarding these patches, we suggest looking at the [Known Security Issues](https://dotcms.com/docs/latest/known-security-issues) pages on the dotCMS Documentation site. 

Unless specified otherwise, these patches are built as OSGi/Dynamic Plugins.  This means that they can be hot loaded into a running dotCMS system without forcing a restart.  They are intended to be temporary and should be removed once you have upgraded to a dotCMS version that contains the code fix in the main code base.
